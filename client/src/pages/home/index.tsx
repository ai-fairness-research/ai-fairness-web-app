            AI systems are becoming a part of our everyday lives, from
            recommending movies to making important decisions about health. But
            sometimes, these systems can miss the mark, especially when they
            donâ€™t consider the diverse experiences and values of all people.
            That's where you come in!
            <br />
            <br />
            AI audits allow individual like you to share your thoughts on how AI
            should work in real-world settings. Your feedback helps developers
            create AI that is fair, unbiased, and works well for everyone.
